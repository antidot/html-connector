# **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

# **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted (read more about [Ruby on rail's team rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

# **Do you intend to add a new feature, change an existing one or contribute to the Rails documentation??**

* Suggest your change in an issue.
* Do not start writting until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

# **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question in Github issues

Thanks!
